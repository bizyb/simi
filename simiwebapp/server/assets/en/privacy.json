You must not access or use the Services if you do not agree with our Privacy Policy. You should also read our Terms of Service because they also apply to your use of the Services.

        "body": "You can’t use Simi if you are younger than 13. In almost all countries, if you are 13 and over, you can allow us to use your data. But, since the law changed in Europe, in some European countries, we need to ask for your parent’s or guardian’s consent before we let you create an account if you are between 13 and 16 years old. This is called the “age of consent”, and it means that if you are under a certain age, we need to get a parental consent. The age varies across different European countries, so it depends on where you live. If you live in the UK, Ireland, Latvia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Spain or Sweden, we won’t need to ask for that extra consent from grownups. If you live in Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg or Netherlands and are aged under 16, you confirm that you have your parent’s consent to sign up to Simi and we will take all reasonable steps to verify this. If you live in France and are aged under 15, you confirm that you have your parent’s consent to sign up to Simi and we will take all reasonable steps to verify this. If you live in Austria and are aged under 14, you confirm that you have your parent’s consent to sign up to Simi and we will take all reasonable steps to verify this."
